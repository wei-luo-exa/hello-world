Third-Party Licenses
=====================

Exabeam AA uses and distributes third-party software under the following licenses:

LOGBACK-CLASSIC-1.1.1.JAR
----------

Please inform appropriate individuals that this has been reviewed, application of GNU LGPL 2.1 is confirmed, and use of LOGBACK-CLASSIC-1.1.1.JAR in our code base is approved by Legal with the following notes:
 
1. Approval is conditioned on maintaining the above FOSS in a separate file that is independent of Exabeam proprietary software after compiling and linking it dynamically (for example, in the case of Java, the library should be maintained in a .jar file).  To be clear, if LOGBACK-CLASSIC-1.1.1.JAR is statically linked to Exabeam software (i.e. compiled into), then Exabeam must release object code or source code such that the user can modify the library, which may expose Exabeam IP.

2. Distributions of Exabeam products (which includes SaaS) must include, either within the product as a legal notice on the help page or within the applicable documentation:
 * The original source code, or a link to the repository from which it was downloaded.
 * The full text of the LGPL license with distributions, which can be found here: https://opensource.org/licenses/LGPL-2.1
 * The following notice:
     ::

3. This review assumes that NO MODIFICATIONS have been or will be made to the source software. Any modifications would require a resubmission for Legal review.

4. Compliance requires that the attribution document be updated to identify/track ALL items, including:
 * Name/version of FOSS as included in the Exabeam Product(s)
 * Version(s) of the Exabeam Product(s) containing the FOSS IP
 * Name of the FOSS license
 * Copyright notice
 * The URL(s) for the download AND for the FOSS license (if different)

5. Exabeam Legal recommends maintaining an ORIGINAL copy of the FOSS download in Exabeam's own repository as best practices in case the original source code or link ceases to be accessible.
